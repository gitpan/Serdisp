=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Serdisp;

    my $d = Serdisp->new('USB:7c0/1501', 'ctinclud');
    $d->init();
    $d->clear();

    # reserves a color-indexed picture
    my $image = GD::Image->new(128,64);
    my $black = $image->colorAllocate(0,0,0);
    my $white = $image->colorAllocate(255,255,255);

    $image->transparent($black);
    $image->arc(10,10,10,10,0,270, $white);
    $d->copyGD($image);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This library is a quick interface to serdisplib.

=head1 PUBLIC INTERFACE

=over 4

=item C<$d = Serdisp-E<gt>new(connection,displaytype)>

This will open the serdisp library for you. The first string
is some kind of connector that describes the kind of interface
your are using to talk to your display:

Examples:

   /dev/parport0 - parallel port
   0x378 - direct IO
   USB:7c0/1501 - USB device with the given product id
   ...

The second is the type of the display.

Examples:

   ctinclud
   PCD8544
   ...

=cut

=item C<$d-E<gt>init()>

This will init the display and turn it on. The the display can't
found with your specified parameter the method will croak.

=item C<$d-E<gt>width()>

Returns the width of the display in pixel.

=item C<$d-E<gt>copyGD(GD)>

This will copy your given GD object into the buffer of the serdisp library.
After that the display will be updated to display the content of the internal
buffer. All non-black pixels (red >0 || green > 0 || blue > 0) will be translated
to a set pixel on the display.
No dithering at all!

If you GD area is bigger than your display the rest of the GD area will be ignored.

If you GD area is lesser than your display the rest of the display area will be untouched.

=item C<$d-E<gt>clear()>

Will clear the internal buffer of the serdisp library and force an update
of the display.

=head2 EXPORT

None by default.
